Clearance Product in retail is a critical solution designed to optimize inventory liquidation while maximizing profitability and reducing operational overhead. It enables retailers to systematically identify, manage, and execute markdown strategies for slow-moving, seasonal, or end-of-life merchandise. The system leverages historical sales data, demand forecasts, price elasticity, and predefined business rules to recommend clearance actions across categories and locations..

I developed a suite of enterprise-grade vendor APIs — including Location, Vendor Contact, Vendor Profile, Vendor Payment, and more — to standardize vendor data access for downstream systems. These APIs support over 100+ consuming applications, handling a throughput of 5,000 transactions per second (TPS), and are integrated into an event-driven architecture to ensure real-time data distribution and scalability.
